# Podco Backend


I built Podco, an AI-powered tool that helps you learn from educational videos (lectures, podcasts, etc.) more effectively.
How it works: 
1. Paste a YouTube (or other) video URL
2. AI converts the video into a structured article 
3. Generates a quiz to test your understanding
4. You can also share your pods with your friends.

This repo contains backend code for podco.
